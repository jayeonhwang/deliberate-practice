# 9. Convert an array of hashes into a hash of arrays, using the author as keys and the titles as values.
# For example, [{author: "Jeff Smith", title: "Bone"}, {author: "George Orwell", title: "1984"}, {author: "Jeff Smith", title: "RASL"}] becomes {"Jeff Smith" => ["Bone", "RASL"], "George Orwell" => ["1984"]}.

# 10. Given a hash, create a new hash that has the keys and values switched.
# For example, {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3} becomes {1 => "a", 2 => "b", 3 => "c"}.
